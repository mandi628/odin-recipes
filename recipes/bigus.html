    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditionally spelled "bigos" in Poland, Ukrainian Bigus is similar. Roasted cabbage, sauerkraut and sausage are staples to this dish, but variations across the world make this dish different in every household. I like to think of it as the "root cellar overflow" dish. Read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigos">on Wikipedia</a> to find out more.</p>
    <p>While this recipe takes at least 3 hours to make in the oven, it's worth it. You can also use a crockpot by cooking the onions first, then adding the rest of the ingredients and cooking on Low for 4-6 hours.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 stick of butter</li>
        <li>1 medium head of cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>1 16-oz. jar sauerkraut</li>
        <li>1 pound Polish kielbasa</li>
        <li>salt & pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350.</li>
        <li>Place the butter in a roasting pan, and place the pan in the oven while it preheats. Meanwhile, slice the onion.</li>
        <li>When the butter is melted, add the onion to the roasting pan. Stir and place the pan back in the oven.</li>
        <li>While the onion starts cooking, shred the cabbage.</li>
        <li>After about 30 minutes, remove the pan from the oven. Stir in the cabbage and put back in the oven, covered, for about one hour.</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the cabbage is done, drain and rinse the sauerkraut. Rinse and squeeze the sauerkrau several times to remove the pickling water.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven and stir in the sauerkraut. Place the pan back in the oven, covered, for another hour.</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauerkraut is done, slice the sausage into circles. To stretch it further, slice the sausage the long way first, then slice into half-circles.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven and stir in the sausage. Place the pan back in the oven, covered, for at least one hour more.</li>
        <li>Stir every 30 minutes until done. The dish is done when the cabbage and sauerkraut are the same color, and the sausage is just starting to brown.</li>
    </ol>
