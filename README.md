# odin-recipes
My first Git project
This current project is a sample of writing a webpage in the text editor, and will have several recipes linked from the homepage. It is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodineproject.com) Foundations Course. This project demonstrates my ability to write in basic HTML, maintain a Git project, and distribute it through GitHub.
